## Summary
The objective of this project is to develop a mapping system for 3D environments. The system will be capable of processing data from depth maps, images, and position and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to create detailed and accurate 3D point clouds. The output of the system will be in common 3D point cloud file formats, which can be easily viewed and processed using various point cloud visualization and processing software. Users will have the ability to input a folder containing the data and specify the output file for the point cloud. mapper utilizes the Mid-Air dataset from the University of Li√®ge. 

This project is being submitted for the German science fair "Jugend Forscht" in 2022/2023.

## Features
- Mapping of Data
- Visualization of surroundings just from sensor data

# This project is made with academic purpose only.
