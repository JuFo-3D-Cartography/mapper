# Mapping system for mapping in 3-D surrounding 
> A mapping system for applications in 3D environments.

## Summary
This project is focused on the development of a mapping system for 3D environments. The system will be able to process data from depth maps, images, and position and IMU sensors to create detailed and accurate 3D pointclouds. The output of the system will be in common 3D pointcloud file formats, which can be easily viewed and processed using various pointcloud visualization and processing software. Users will be able to input a folder containing the data and specify the output file for the pointcloud. We are using the Dataset of [Mid-Air](https://midair.ulg.ac.be/index.html). This project is a contribution to the german science fair "Jugend Forscht" in the Year 2022/2023.
